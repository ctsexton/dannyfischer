Danny Fischer is one of the most in demand and highly sort after freelance jazz drummers currently 
working in Australia. There is scarcely a jazz musician in Australia that Danny has not worked with at one time or another. 
After graduating from the Victorian College of the Arts (Melbourne University) he had a highly successful teaching 
and performing career across the country working with many visiting overseas artists such as James Williams, Gary Bartz, 
Gordon Brisker, Paul Bollenback, Mark Murphy, Curtis Lundy, and Australian ex patriot’s Lisa Parrott, Anita Wardell, Trudie Kerr 
among others. During this time he appeared on over 30 recordings including Andrea Kellerʼs ARIA award winning debut CD 13 Sketches.
In 2000 Danny relocated to London which provided a European base while he studied with 
two of Europeʼs most respected improvising percussionists, Roger Turner and Paul Lovens.
Upon returning to Melbourne in 2001 Danny joined Andrea Kellerʼs Bartok ensemble and
released ʻMikrokosmosʼ in 2002 winning an ARIA and a Bell award. Other notable
recordings during this time include multiple releases from trumpeter Paul Williamson,
saxophonist David Rex, Kynan Robinsonʼs ensemble En Rusk, Andrea Keller’s Quartet 
and Jamie Oehlers’ recording ‘The Assemblers’ which was also awarded a Bell award in 2004.
In June of that year Danny toured Europe as a member of Jamie Oehlersʼ quartet with
performances at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland and Ronnie Scottʼs Jazz
Club in London. Following this tour he then relocated to New York.
Soon after arriving in the city he formed the co-operative quartet ʻSpokeʼ and became a
member of the critically acclaimed group ʻBryan & the Haggardsʼ and ʻJon Lundbom &
Big Five Chordʼ with multiple CD releases. The group ʻSpokeʼ recently won third place in 
an international jazz competition in Macau and has released three albums.
During this time Danny undertook drum study/mentorship with Master Drummer Michael Carvin 
whose core principles about life/drumming remain a core element to Danny’s performing and teaching ethic.
