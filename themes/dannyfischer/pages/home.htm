		Danny Fischer left a huge gap in the music scene of his native Melbourne, Australia when he relocated to New York in 2004. A 2002 review called Danny “possibly the most in-demand jazz drummer in Melbourne, having worked with a long list of Australian and international musicians including Barney McAll, Gary Bartz, James Williams, George Colligan & Paul Bollenbeck…..” Since relocating to New York, he has been in demand as a sideman, having just recently returned from a tour of Australia with Kurt Rosenwinkel and Barney McAll and has performed at Radio City Music Hall alongside Patty LaBelle, Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight and Diana Ross.
